Olog Service Documentation!
===========================

Olog is an online logbook service which allows for the creation and retrieval of log entries.

The service was developed to address the needs of operators, engineers, and users of large scientific facilities.

Key features:
 - Integration with CS-Studio, Phoebus, Bluesky, and other controls and data acquisition tools.
 - Tags & Logbooks provide an effective way to organize and sort log entries
 - Support for fuzzy searching
 - Markup support for creating rich text log entries. Markup is based on the Commonmark specification, extended
   with support for image size and tables. Clients may request a HTML formatted quick reference (maintained
   in the project) resource using an URL like http(s)://url.to.service/CommonmarkCheatsheet.html.
