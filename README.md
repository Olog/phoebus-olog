[Phoebus Olog Documentation](https://olog.readthedocs.io/)

### Installation
Olog 

* Prerequisites

  * JDK 11 or newer
  * Elastic version 8.2.x
  * mongo gridfs


 **Download links for the prerequisites**   
 Download and install elasticsearch (verision 8.2.x) from [elastic.com](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-8-2-3)    
 Download and install mongodb from [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)    
  
  
* Configure the service (optional)
The configuration files for olog-es are present under `phoebus-olog/tree/master/src/main/resources` 


* Build 
```
cd phoebus-olog
mvn clean install
``` 

* Build deployable jar

To build a jar with dependencies and Tomcat server, use Maven profile `deployable-jar`, e.g.:
```
cd phoebus-olog
mvn -Pdeployable-jar clean install
```

#### Start the service  

Using spring boot  

```
mvn org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-maven-plugin:run
```

#### Check if service is running

Once the service is running, the service consists of a welcome page `http://localhost:8080/Olog` 
which will provide information about the version of the Olog service running,
along with information about the version and connection status of the elastic and mongo
backends.

### Running using Docker Compose

**Prerequisites**

* Docker Compose
* Adequate 'mmap count' for ElasticSearch: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html
  * On linux, you can run `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144` to set this
* Adequate memory lock limit for ElasticSearch
  * You can check this with `ulimit -l` - you can set it to `unlimited` but the command varies

**Run**

* Build the image: `docker-compose build`
* Run the containers: `docker-compose up`

### Release Olog Server binaries to maven central

The Phoebus Olog service uses the maven release plugin to prepare the publish the olog server binaries to maven central
using the sonatype repositories.

**Setup**

Create a sonatype account and update the maven settings.xml file with your sonatype credentials

```
  <servers>
   <server>
      <id>phoebus-releases</id>
      <username>shroffk</username>
      <password>*******</password>
   </server>
  </servers>
```

**Prepare the release**  
`mvn release:prepare`  
In this step will ensure there are no uncommitted changes, ensure the versions number are correct, tag the scm, etc..
A full list of checks is documented [here](https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/examples/prepare-release.html):

**Perform the release**  
`mvn release:perform`  
Checkout the release tag, build, sign and push the build binaries to sonatype.
**NOTE:** Mac OS users should invoke `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` prior to `mvn release:perform`.

**Publish**  
Open the staging repository in [sonatype](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories) and hit the *publish* button
